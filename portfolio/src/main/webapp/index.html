    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Annie and I’m currently a second year Software Engineering student at UNSW and a STEP Intern at Google 2020. 
        I’m into software development, especially in the backend side and security engineering. 
        My passion for technology and software stemmed from my curiosity and obsession with video games when I was younger. 
        I was always curious into how games were developed and really wanted to make one myself. That was what put me into a path of Software Engineering. 
        Nowadays I still spend a lot of my free time playing video games, however I have shifted my career interest from games to general software programming.</p>
